# Robinhood AI Trading Bot

<img src="images/avatar.png" width="277" alt="Robinhood AI Trading Bot"/>

## ⚡ Overview
The **Robinhood AI Trading Bot** is a simple Python script
that combines **OpenAI's intelligence** with **Robinhood's trading capabilities**
to help automate and optimize stock trading decisions.
By analyzing **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**,
**Moving Averages**, and **Robinhood analyst ratings**, the bot generates buy, sell,
and hold recommendations — executing trades automatically based on your selected mode.

## 🤔 Why This Bot?
This project is an experiment
to explore how AI can enhance stock trading decisions — potentially outperforming human traders
(or at least me, The Bot Father).

## ⚠️ Important Considerations
- **Start in Demo or Manual Mode** before enabling Auto Mode.
- **Test thoroughly** to fine-tune AI decision-making.
- **Monitor trade logs** to understand AI-driven actions.

## 🛠 Features
✅ **AI-Driven Trading** – Smart, data-backed buy/sell decisions.  
✅ **Portfolio & Watchlist Integration** – Trade directly from your Robinhood stocks.  
✅ **Configurable Strategy** – Set trading parameters to fit your risk profile.  
✅ **Exclusion List** – Prevent trading specific stocks.  
✅ **Logging & Analytics** – Track bot activity and trading history.  
✅ **Workday Scheduling** – Align trading activity with market hours.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Connect Your Accounts**: Add your OpenAI API Key and Robinhood credentials.
2. **Choose a Mode**:
   - **Demo Mode**: Simulates trades without execution.
   - **Manual Mode**: Requires confirmation before executing trades.
   - **Auto Mode**: Executes trades automatically (recommended only after testing).
3. **Monitor and Adjust**: Review trade logs and fine-tune settings for optimal performance.

## 📊 How It Works
1. **Authenticate**: Logs into OpenAI and Robinhood.
2. **Fetch Data**: Retrieves stocks from your **portfolio** and **watchlist**.
3. **Analyze Market Conditions**:
   - **RSI**: Determines overbought/oversold conditions.
   - **VWAP**: Identifies undervalued/overvalued stocks.
   - **Moving Averages**: Evaluates price trends (50-day and 200-day).
   - **Analyst Ratings**: Incorporates Robinhood's expert opinions.
4. **AI-Driven Decisions**: Uses OpenAI to generate trading recommendations.
5. **Trade Execution**: Buys, sells, or holds stocks based on AI insights.
6. **Continuous Monitoring**: Repeats analysis and trades as the market evolves.

## 📈 Analytical System
### **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
- Measures momentum on a **0-100 scale**.
- **Above 70**: Overbought (potential sell signal).
- **Below 30**: Oversold (potential buy signal).

### **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**
- Calculates the **average price** adjusted for volume.
- **Above VWAP**: Overvalued (potential sell signal).
- **Below VWAP**: Undervalued (potential buy signal).

### **Moving Averages**
- **50-day & 200-day moving averages** help detect trends.
- **Golden Cross (50-day crosses above 200-day)**: Bullish signal.
- **Death Cross (50-day crosses below 200-day)**: Bearish signal.

### **Robinhood Analyst Ratings**
- Aggregates **buy, hold, and sell** recommendations.
- Provides sentiment analysis based on expert insights.

## 🤖 AI-Powered Decision Making
The bot formulates decisions using OpenAI based on:
- RSI, VWAP, moving averages, and analyst ratings.
- User-defined constraints (e.g., budget, stock exclusions, portfolio size).
- Pattern Day Trading (PDT) status to prevent PDT designation.

RUN_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 600                  # Trading interval in seconds (if the market is open)

# Robinhood config parameters
TRADE_EXCEPTIONS = []                       # List of stocks to exclude from trading (e.g. ["AAPL", "TSLA", "AMZN"])
WATCHLIST_NAMES = []                        # Watchlist names (can be empty, or "My First List", "My Second List", etc.)

```

#### Robinhood MFA Setup
If MFA is enabled, you'll need to provide an MFA code. There are two options:

##### Option 1: Use `ROBINHOOD_MFA_SECRET` (Local MFA Code)
If you prefer to set the MFA secret directly, follow these steps:
1. Log in to your Robinhood account on your phone. Important to use your phone because it will display the secret key but not the QR code.
2. Navigate to the security settings.
3. Enable MFA if it is not already enabled. When setting up MFA, you will be asked to select an authentication method on your phone. Choose "Authenticator app" and Robinhood will provide you with a secret key. This is your `ROBINHOOD_MFA_SECRET`.
4. Copy this secret key and set it as the `ROBINHOOD_MFA_SECRET` environment variable or paste it directly into the `config.py` file.
5. Enter the same secret key into your authentication app on the same PC where you run the script (e.g., Google Authenticator). Note: If you enter the secret on a different device, it will generate a different value.
6. After entering the same secret on the same PC, use the generated TOTP number to authenticate with the Robinhood app.

##### Option 2: Use 1Password (Auto MFA Retrieval)
If you do not set the `ROBINHOOD_MFA_SECRET` environment variable, the script will attempt to retrieve the MFA secret from 1Password using the following credentials:
```python
# 1Password Credentials
OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME = "..."             # 1Password service account name (for Robinhood MFA secret)
OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN = "..."            # 1Password service account token (for Robinhood MFA secret)
OP_VAULT_NAME = "..."                       # 1Password vault name (for Robinhood MFA secret)
OP_ITEM_NAME = "..."                        # 1Password item name (for Robinhood MFA secret)
```

To use this feature:
1. Ensure the above 1Password credentials are correctly configured in your environment or `config.py` file.
2. Store your Robinhood MFA secret in the specified 1Password vault and item.
3. The script will automatically fetch the MFA secret from 1Password if `ROBINHOOD_MFA_SECRET` is not provided.

For more information on setting up 1Password Service Accounts, read the guide: [Get started with 1Password Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/get-started/)
